## Figure 1: Task-Consistency of Auxiliary Gradients
**File:** `figure1_task_consistency.png/pdf`

**Purpose:** Validates Proposition 1 (Descent certificate) by showing that auxiliary gradients maintain positive alignment with task gradients throughout training.

**What it shows:**
- Left panel: cos(D_i, A_i) values across epochs for each locus (L1, L2, L3)
- Right panel: β_i = r_i * cos(D_i, A_i) effective descent coefficients
- All values remain positive, certifying that auxiliary gradients contribute to task loss descent

**Key findings:**
- Consistently positive cosine values (>0) across all epochs and loci
- β values are positive and increasing with training progress
- L1 and L2 show stronger task-consistency than L3

## Figure 2: Small-α FP32 Alignment Improvement  
**File:** `figure2_fp32_alignment.png/pdf`

**Purpose:** Demonstrates that small mixing coefficients improve FP32 alignment (Fact 2).

**What it shows:**
- Δcos^FP_i(α) = cos(S_i(α), A_i^FP) - cos(A_i, A_i^FP) at α=0.1
- Positive values indicate improved FP32 alignment through mixing
- Statistical significance markers (*, **, ***) show confidence levels

**Key findings:**
- Positive Δcos values across all epochs confirm theoretical predictions
- L1 and L2 show larger improvements than L3
- Alignment improvement is statistically significant throughout training

## Figure 3: FP32-Parallel Magnitude Gain
**File:** `figure3_magnitude_gain.png/pdf`

**Purpose:** Shows that despite possible cosine decreases at larger α, the effective FP32-parallel component magnitude increases.

**What it shows:**
- M_i(α) = ||S_i(α)|| cos(S_i(α), A_i^FP) / (||A_i|| cos(A_i, A_i^FP))
- Three panels for epochs 10, 150, and 300
- M > 1 indicates net gain in FP32-parallel signal strength

**Key findings:**
- M(α) > 1 for α > 0.2 across all loci and epochs
- L1 and L2 achieve higher gains than L3
- Explains why larger α values improve practical performance

## Figure 4: Safe Mixing Window
**File:** `figure4_safe_mixing_window.png/pdf`

**Purpose:** Provides a 2D view of the trade-off between curvature safety and FP32 gain to guide α selection.

**What it shows:**
- X-axis: M_i(α) - FP32-parallel magnitude gain
- Y-axis: ρ_i(α) = cos²(S_i(α), A_i) - curvature safety metric
- Trajectory shows how both metrics change as α increases from 0 to 1

**Key findings:**
- Safe mixing region: M > 1 (gain) AND ρ ≥ 0.8 (safe curvature)
- L1 and L2 maintain high safety (ρ > 0.8) while achieving M > 1
- L3 shows faster ρ degradation, requiring more conservative α selection
- Optimal α range appears to be 0.1-0.5 for balancing safety and gain

## Technical Notes

- All figures use Dsum (sum of auxiliary gradients) as the primary analysis target
- Error bars show 95% confidence intervals
- Data aggregated across batches and seeds for statistical robustness
- Color scheme: L1 (blue), L2 (magenta), L3 (orange)
- Figures are publication-ready with high DPI (300) for print quality

## Theoretical Connections

1. **Figure 1** → Proposition 1: Validates descent preservation condition
2. **Figure 2** → First-order analysis: Confirms positive derivative at α=0
3. **Figure 3** → Practical benefit: Explains performance gains at large α
4. **Figure 4** → Hyperparameter guidance: Provides principled α selection

These figures collectively demonstrate that auxiliary gradient mixing:
- Maintains task-consistency (descent preservation)
- Improves FP32 alignment (precision recovery)
- Delivers magnitude gains (effective signal amplification)
- Operates within safe curvature bounds (optimization stability)
